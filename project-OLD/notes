HIGH PRIORITY TASKS
Register wasnt getting updated on time
do_ecall function (1)
Load and Store Instruction handling in WB phase 
Instruction cache (this is done)
Data cache (1)
JUMPs/JALR instructions (1)
Support for memory read/write - making sure the control signals are correctly implemented + check logs to see if this is working (string to look for -- Received pending write for address)
researching + adding hazards & stalls as needed
Branch predictor
LOW PRIORITY TASKS
Pipeline register i/o need be organized into structs [pipeline_defs.sv]


Data cache - data invalidation during ecalls
Mem write - store
dcache - mem reads - simultaneously writes to the cache and memory

Build dependencies (make sure wb finishes first)
Also start using WP2 (RISC-V 150 page - All instructions in scope - 34, 64, I & M)
Memory - axi_

Branch & Jumps : Have some sort of calculations (be careful with signed imms)
Stalls: dcache stall, fetch stalls, branch stalls,
